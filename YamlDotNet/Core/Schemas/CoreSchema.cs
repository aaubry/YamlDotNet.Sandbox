	/// </summary>

	/// The Core schema is an extension of the JSON schema,
	/// allowing for more human-readable presentation of the same types.
	/// This is the recommended default schema that YAML processor
	/// should use unless instructed otherwise.
	/// It is also strongly recommended that other schemas should be based on it.
